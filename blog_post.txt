[H채ngematte 체ber M체nchen?]

Servus M체nchen! Imagine you're planning to travel to Munich, the capital of Bavaria, close to the Alps. You have considered all options where to stay, but this time you would like to book your accomodation via AirBnB.
With a decent budget, you would now like to know where to find the best trade-off between price & location (i.e., staying close to the city centre). Can you spot it?

What do previous visitors say about the best & worst hosts? Why might some appartments have not been booked at all?

Finally, while reading the listings, you pay attention to those hosts with the best rankings. You also consider whether a host has had only a few ratings or several. Is there an influence of the quality and the amount of rankings on bookings though?
